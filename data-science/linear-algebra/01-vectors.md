# Vectors

## Overview

* __Vectors__

    1. `vectors` are `arrows in space`.

    2. `vectors` have an `origin`, `direction`, and `length`.

    3. `vectors` are `ordered lists of numbers`.

    * `vectors` are normally written in a vertical format. 

        ```
        +- -+
        | 1 |
        | 2 |
        | 3 |
        +- -+
        ```

    * `vectors` have a `spatial` interpretation in a cartesian n-dimensional space.

    * `vectors` can be handled algebraically.

* __Vector Arithmetic__

    * __Addition__ - Vectors of the same size (dimensionality) can be added by adding the corresponding elements together.

        ```
        +- -+   +- -+   +- -+
        | 1 |   | 2 |   | 3 |
        | 2 | + | 3 | = | 5 |
        | 3 |   | 4 |   | 7 |
        +- -+   +- -+   +- -+
        ```

    * __Scalar Multiplication__ - All elements in a vector can be `scaled` by a constant.

        ```
        +- -+         +- -+
        | 1 |         | 3 |
        | 2 | *  3  = | 6 |
        | 3 |         | 9 |
        +- -+         +- -+
        ```
