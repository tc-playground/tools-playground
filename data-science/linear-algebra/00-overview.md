# Linear Algebra

## Overview

* `Linear algebra` is the mathematics of `data`.

* `Linear algebra` underlies many practical mathematical tools, such as statistics, Fourier series and computer graphics.

* __Linear Algebra Applications__

    * `Matrices` in Engineering, such as a line of springs.

    * `Graphs` and `Networks`, such as analyzing networks.

    * `Markov Matrices`, Population, and Economics, such as population growth.

    * `Linear Programming`, the simplex optimization method.

    * `Fourier Series`: Linear Algebra for functions, used widely in signal processing.

    * Linear Algebra for `statistics` and `probability`, such as `least squares for regression`.

    * `Computer Graphics`, such as the various `translation`, `rescaling` and `rotation` of images.
