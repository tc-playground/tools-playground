## Introduction

* __Elimination__ A method to solve a set of linear equations. Usually expressed as `matrix operations`.

    * Will `succeed` if the matrix is good.

    * Will `fail` if one or more `column vectors` lie on same `n-dimensional plane`.

* __Back Substitution__

* __Elimination Matrices__

* __Matrix Multiplication__

## Elimination

```
 x + 2y + z = 2
3x + 9y + z = 12
     4y + z = 2


| 1 2 1 |
| 2 9 1 |
| 0 4 1 |

   A
```
