# Nmap (Network Mapper)

## Introduction

1. `nmap` is a `network scanner`.

2. `map` is used to discover `hosts` and `services` on a computer network by `sending packets` and analyzing the responses. 

    1. __Host discovery__ – Identifying `hosts on a network`. For example, listing the hosts that respond to TCP and/or ICMP requests or have a particular port open.

    2. __Port scanning__ – Enumerating the `open ports` on `target hosts`.

    3. __Version detection__ – Interrogating network services on remote devices to determine application name and version number.

    4. __OS detection__ – Determining the operating system and hardware characteristics of network devices.
