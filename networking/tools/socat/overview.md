# socat Multipurpose relay (SOcket CAT)

## Introduction

* `socat` is a `relay` for `bidirectional data transfer` between `two independent data channels`. 

* `socat` can be used for many different purposes.

* `socat` establishes `two bidirectional byte streams` and `transfers data between them`. 

* `socat` `streams` can be constructed from a large set of different `address types` of `data sinks` and `sources`.

    * `file`, `pipe`, `device` (terminal or modem), `socket` (UNIX, TCP, UDP, IP6, raw), a `file descriptor`, a `program`.
       
* `socat` can apply lots of `address options` may be applied to the `streams`.

* Related tools include `netcat` and `telnet`
