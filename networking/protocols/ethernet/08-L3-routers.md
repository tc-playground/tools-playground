## Introduction

* `Layer 3 - Network Layer`

* `Layer 3 Switches` have `routing capabilities`.

* `routers` select the _best path_ to reach the destination.

    * The are several protocols to gather the data to determine the path.

* `routers` use `IPv4 addresses` or `IPv6 addresses` to specify the destination.

* `routers` transfer packets `between networks`.

* `routers` are the `gateway` into and out of a `network`.
