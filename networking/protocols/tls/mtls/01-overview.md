# mTLS

## Introduction

* `TLS` (Transport Layer Security) provides the necessary encryption for applications when communicating over a network. 

* `HTTPS` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that leverages TLS for security.

* `mTLS` or `Mutual TLS` is a process where secure transmission of data is achieved by both the `server` and the `client`.
