# Apache Avro

## Introduction

* `Avro` is an `interface definition language` and `binary communication protocol` for `RPC`.

* `Avro` is a `row oriented remote procedure call` mechanism.

* `Avro` is a `data serialization` mechanism.

* `Avro` uses `JSON` for `defining` data types and protocols, and `serializes` data in a `compact binary format`.

* `Avro` is used in `Apache Hadoop`:

    * `serialization format` - Persistent data.
    
    * `wire format` - Data transmission.

* `Avro` does not require running a code-generation program when a schema changes (unless desired for statically-typed languages).  

* `Avro`  is similar to `Thrift` and `Protocol Buffers`.
