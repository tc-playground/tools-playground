# JSON-RPC

## Introduction

* `JSON-RPC` is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in `JSON`. 

* `JSON-RPC` allows for `notifications` (data sent to the server that does not require a response).

* `JSON_RPC` allows for `multiple calls` to be sent to the server which may be answered `asynchronously`. 

* `JSON-RPC` is similar to the `XML-RPC` protocol.
