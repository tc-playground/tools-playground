# STFM32-F407

## Introduction

* The `STM32F4` family incorporates:

    * High-speed embedded memories.
    
    * A range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to: 
    
        * 2 `APB` buses.
        
        * 3 `AHB` buses.
        
        * 32-bit `multi-AHB bus matrix`.

  * 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.

  * LCD parallel interface, 8080/6800 modes.

  * Timer with quadrature (incremental) encoder input.

  * 5 V-tolerant I/Os.

  * Parallel camera interface.

  * True random number generator.

  * RTC: sub-second accuracy, hardware calendar.

  * 96-bit unique ID.
