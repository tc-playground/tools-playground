## Buses

* __Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) Protocol__ is a intended to allow multiple `peripheral` digital integrated circuits (`chips`) to communicate with one or more `controller` chips.

    * Intended for short distance communications within a single device.

* __Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)__

* __Asynchronous Serial Interfaces__  - Requires two signal wires to exchange information.

    * `RS-232`

    * `UART`
