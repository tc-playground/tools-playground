## Ball Grid Array (BGA)

* `Ball Grid Arrays (BGA)` are a type of surface-mount packaging (a chip carrier) used for integrated circuits. 

* `BGA packages` are used to permanently mount devices such as `microprocessors`.

## Buses

* __Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) Protocol__ is a intended to allow multiple `peripheral` digital integrated circuits (`chips`) to communicate with one or more `controller` chips.

    * Intended for short distance communications within a single device.

    * [I²C - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)

    * [I²C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all)

* __Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)__

* __Asynchronous Serial Interfaces__  - Requires two signal wires to exchange information.

    * `RS-232`

    * `UART`

## Cross Tool Chain

* `cross toolchain` — a toolchain designed to build software for one CPU architecture on a system running a different architecture.

* Small Partial `Libc` implementations: `musl`, `mClibc-ng`.
