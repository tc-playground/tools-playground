# Kubernetes

## Introduction

* `Kubernetes` is an `orchestration` platform for `container based applications`.

    > `container based applications` are application are run as `(docker) containers`. Common for `microservices`.

* `Kubernetes` manages the `life-cycle` of `containers` in the `application`:

    1. `Deployment` - Deploying the application in whole or in part, or, new versions of it.

    2. `Scaling` - Dealing with load by scaling resources in and out elastically.

## Container Orchestration Platform Requirements

1. Shared networking between hundreds of processes all binding to the same port.

2. Migration and decoupling of storage volumes from binaries.

3. Deliver high process density without the `noisy neighbour problem`.

4. Storage aware scheduling - The ability to schedule a process in concert with making its data available.

5. Service-aware network load balancing â€” The ability to send traffic to different IP addresses as containers move from one machine to another.
