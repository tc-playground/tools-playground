# Random Variables

## Introduciton

* A `variable` whose `values` depend on `outcomes of a random phenomenon`.

* A `random variable` is a `measurable function` defined on a `probability space` that maps from the `sample space` to the `real numbers`.

* `random variables` have `domain` that is its `sample space`.

* `random variables` have a `probability distribution`, which specifies the probability of an `outcome to an experiment` being within in a range of values.

* `random variables` can have `discrete outcomes`.

    * These have the `probability mass function` of the random variable's probability distribution.

* `random variables` can have `continuous outcomes`.

    * These have the `probability density function` of the random variable's probability distribution.

    * These work on `ranges`.

* `Multiple random variables` can be `dependent` or `independent`.
