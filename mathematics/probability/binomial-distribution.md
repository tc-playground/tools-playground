# Binomial (Bernoulli) Distribution

## Introduction

* The `binomial distribution` with parameters `n` and `p` is:

    * The `discrete probability distribution` of the number of successes in a sequence of __n__ `independent experiments`.

    * Each `independent experiment` asks a yes/no boolean question. (`Bernoulli trial`).

        * `successes` have a probability of `p`.

        * `failures` have a probability of `1 - p`.
    
* The `binomial distribution` is used to model:

    * The number of successes in a `sample size` __n__ drawn with `replacement` from a `population of size` __N__.

    * If `replacement` is not performed, the `draws are not independent`
    
        * This result in a `hypergeometric distribution`.
