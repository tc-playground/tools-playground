# Probability Density Function

> When finding the probabilities using a `continuous distribution`, the probability of obtaining an exact value is zero. A range must be used.


* A `probability density function (PDF)` is a function that:

    * Gives the `probability` that a `continuous random variable` is _exactly equal_ to some `value`.


* `probability mass functions` instantiations are essentiality `histograms` for a set of `discrete values`.
    
* `probability mass functions` are a primary means of defining a `discrete probability distribution`.

* `probability mass functions` exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is __discrete__.
    
* `probability mass functions` are sometimes named `discrete density function`.

* A `probability mass function` differs from a `probability density function (PDF)`:

    * `probability mass function` are for `discrete random variables`.

    * `probability density functions `continuous random variables` and must be `integrated over an interval` to yield a probability. 

* The `mode` of a `probability mass function` is the `value` of the `random variable` having the `largest probability mass`.
