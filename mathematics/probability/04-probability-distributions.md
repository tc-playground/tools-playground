# Probability Distributions

## Continuous Probability Distribution

* A probability distribution that maps to a `real value`. NB: As opposed to `discrete` values.

    * e.g. `spin the bottle` the result is an angle in degrees >= 0 and < 360.

## What is a Density Function?

* A `density` is a probability for `continuous spaces`. 

* For a `continuous probability distribution`, the `y-axis` represents a `probability density function`.

* A `density function` is just an equation to mathematically represent a `continuous distribution`. 

* The `integral` (area under the curve between two limits) of the `probability density function` is the probability of an event in that range. 

    * NB: Taking the integral is the same as calculating the area under the curve.

* An exact `point` in a `continuous probability distribution` is always `0`.

* The area under a `continuous probability distribution`  always sums to `1`.

* `densities` can be: 

    * `>`. NB: Just the area under the full distribution must sum to 1.

    * They do not need to be a continuous function. e.g. Step density functions. 

* `densities` cannot be:

    * A `negative number` (they can be 0).

## Uniform Continuous Probability Distributions

* Like 'spin the bottle'.

* This is a straight line at `1 / 360` where the y-axis ranges from 0 -360.

* The probability between a specified range is easy to calculate as it is a rectangle.

* So the probability of it landing in the range of 0 - 180 is:

    * `1/360 * 180` or `1/2` or `0.5`.

## Non-uniform Continuous Probability Distributions

* Like 'time of day when people are born' - when it is twice as likely to be born in the morning.

    * NB: `Piece-wise Continuous Probability Distributions` as it has too parts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise
