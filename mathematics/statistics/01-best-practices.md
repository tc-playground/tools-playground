## Basic Data Analysis

1. __Distribution Analysis__: What are the common subjects, duration, and price points of courses?

2. __Combining Features__: Can we combine any columns for more interesting features?

3. __Comparing Features with Target Variable__: Can we get any initial insights on what leads to a successful course?

4. __Building a Model__: Can we predict which courses are the most successful?

5. __Improving and Deploying the Model__: What are the next steps we can take to build a better model and make it easy for others to access?
