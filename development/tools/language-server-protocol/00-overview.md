# Language Server Protocol

## Overview

* The idea behind a `Language Server` is to `provide the language-specific smarts inside a server` that can communicate with `development tooling` over a `protocol` that enables `inter-process communication`.

* The idea behind the `Language Server Protocol (LSP)` is to standardize the `protocol` for how `tools` and `servers` communicate.

> The idea is to have one tool (language server) for each language. This can then be used from mulitple tools e.g. `VScode`, `vim`, etc.
