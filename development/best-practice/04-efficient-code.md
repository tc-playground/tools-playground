# Efficient Code

## Introduction

> `efficient code` is about considering and optimising `time complexity` and `space complexity`.


---

## Best Practices

1. __Know your data structures and which methods are faster__

    1. __Sets__ - Avoid duplicates, intersections, unions.

2. __Use vector operations over loops when possible__

    1. __Python__ - `numpy` and `pandas` have `vector operation` that make things faster.

        1. `numpy.intersect1d` -  How to find common elements in two `numpy arrays`.
