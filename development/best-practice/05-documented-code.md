# Effective Documented Code

## Introduction

> `effective documentation` should exist at different levels and aim to explain the things the code cannot.


---

## Best Practices

1. __Inline Comments__ - Embedded `in-line` with code blocks.

2. __Module Comments__ - Comments at the `module`, `function`, `class level`.

    * `Doc Strings`

3. __Project Documentation__ - `README` files, and files that explain how the project is built and the pieces fit together.
