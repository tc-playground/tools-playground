# Software Development Best Practices

## Overview

1. __Clean Code__ - `Readable`, `Simple`, and `Concise`.

2. __Modular Code__ - Logically broken up into `functions` and `modules`. 

3. __Reliable Code__ - Good `unit testing` and `integration testing`.

4. __Efficient Code__ - 

5. __Documented Code__ - Have _effective_ documentation. `Why` it does what it does.

6. __Refactored Code__ - Changing the `internal representation` of code without changing the `external functionality`.

    * Continuously re-visit the _modularisation_ of the code as it evolves.
    * Reduced work in the long run.

7. __Version Controlled Code__

8. __Reviewed Code__
