# Effective Documented Code

## Introduction

> `effective documentation` should exist at different levels and aim to explain the things the code cannot.

---

## Best Practices

1. __Inline Comments__ - Embedded `in-line` with code blocks.

    1. Describe the basic steps in an algorithm.

    2. Explain why certain parameters are set.

    3. Explain any work arounds.


2. __Module Comments__ - Comments at the `module`, `function`, `class level`.

    *  Describe the interface and inputs and outputs to a module/function/class.


3. __Project Documentation__ - `README` files, and files that explain how the project is built and the pieces fit together.

    * Keep a `decision history` log on the major changes to the system and why certain decision were chosen.
