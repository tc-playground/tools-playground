# Instance Principals

> Prevents the need of having to copy required credentials onto instance and rotating them.

## Introduction

* Instances themselves are a new principal type in IAM.

* Each compute instance has its own identity

* Each compute instance authenticates by using certificates that are added to the instance.

* Certificates are added by the new instance principalâ€™s capability.
