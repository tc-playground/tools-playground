# AWS Machine Learning

## Introduciton

* `AWS` offers several `Machine Learning (ML)` frameworks and services.

---

## AWS ML

1. Frameworks / Interfaces

2. ML Services

3. AI Services

---

## ML Models

1. Supervised

2. Unsupervised

3. Reinforcement

---

## Generative AI

### Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANN)

1. Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANN)

    1. Generator

    2. Discriminator (Real vs Fake)

2. Loss Functions

    1. Generator Loss

    2. Discriminator Loss

3. Similarity Index

    1. Tend towards zero and converge.

4. Convergence

    1. May not be a stable state.

5. Hyper Parameters

    1. Set before model generation begins.


### Variational Autoencoders


### Transformers

---

## Sage Maker

1. AWS ML Service for managing ML model creation projects.

    * e.g. Jupyter notebook integration with DeepComposer.

2. Machine Learning Pipeline Steps

    * `Ground Truth` - Dataset, labelling, pre-processing.

    * `Notebook` - Jupyter notebooks.

    * `Training` - Algorithms, training jobs, hyper-parameter tuning.

    * `Inference`.
