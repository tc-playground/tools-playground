# Security Groups

## Introduction

* A `security group` is a `set of firewall rules` that control the traffic for your `instance`. 

    * e.g. Enable `protocol` and ports for `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* Rules permitting traffic can be defined based on packet data:

    1. __Protocol__

    2. __Port Range__ 

    3. __Source IP__
