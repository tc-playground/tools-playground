# Document Object Model (DOM)

## Introduction

* The `DOM` is a tree of `nodes` that map to `HTML Elements`.

* The `DOM` is created from a parsed `HTML` document.

* The `DOM` can be found on the `windows.document` object in a `browser`.

* The `DOM` is object-oriented and nodes contain `properties` and `functions`.

* `JavaScript` can be used to read, write, and, manipulate the `DOM`.

* `Node elements` in the `DOM` can be selected using `Query Selectors`.
