# Testing Design

## Conceptual Breakdown

Create a `test design` for each component in the application:

1. Look at each individual `part` of the `application`.

2. For each `part`, imagine telling a friend 'heres what this `piece` of code does. 

3. Write a test to verify each `piece` does what you expect.
