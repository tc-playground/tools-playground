# Custom Hooks

## Introduction

* Hooks are a way to reuse `stateful logic`, not `state` itself. 

* Multiple related usages of hooks can be abstracted out into a function.

* `Custom hooks` are convention.

* If a functionâ€™s name starts with `use` and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a `custom Hook`.
