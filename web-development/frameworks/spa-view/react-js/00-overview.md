# React

* `React` is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* `event delegation` - `ReactJS` attaches `one handler per event type` to the document node directly, as opposed to attaching it to the DOM nodes on which they were declared. A technique used to reduced computation overhead.
