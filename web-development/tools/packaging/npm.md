# NPM

## Overview

* `NPM` is a package manager for JavaScript/TypeScript libraries.

* `NPM` has mechanisms for `supply chain security`.

* __Scopes__

    * `scope` is a `@-prefixed name` that goes at the start of a `package` name.

        * e.g. `@my-company/foo` is a scope package.
    
    * `Scoped package`s on the public npm registry may `only be published by the user` or organization associated with it.
    
    * `Packages` within a scope may be made `private`.

    * `Scope` names can be `linked` to a given `registry`.
