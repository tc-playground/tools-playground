# RollupJS

## Overview

* `Rollup` is a `module bundler` for JavaScript 

* `Rollup` compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex such as a library or application. 

* `Rollup` uses the new standardized `ES6 Modules` format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript.

    > Idiosyncratic solutions such as `CommonJS` and `AMD` are deprecated. 

* `ES modules` let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. 

    * `ES implemented in modern browsers and not finalised in Node.js. 

* `Rollup` allows you to write code using `ES6 modules`, it will then compile it back down to existing supported formats
    
    * e.g.  `CommonJS` modules, `AMD` modules, and `IIFE-style` scripts. 

* `Rollup` supports `Tree Shaking`.

    * `Rollup` also statically analyzes the code you are importing, and will exclude anything that isn't actually used.

    > Instead of importing an entire library single functions can be used.
