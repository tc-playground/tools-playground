# WebAssembly

* `WebAssembly` is intended to be compilation target.

* `WebAssembly` is designed to have a `compact binary form`.

* `WebAssembly` is designed to support `streaming compilation`.

* `WebAssembly` can work with many languages but does not include standard libraries.

* `WebAssembly` is `sand-boxed`, and, protects against some classes of `exploit`.

* `WebAssembly bytecode` is executed by a `virtual machine`.

    > This virtual machine only has access to `Web APIs` and not the entire operating system (unlike the `JVM`, etc).

* `WebAssembly files` can be verified and compiled by the `virtual machine` in a `single pass`.
