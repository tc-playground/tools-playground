# Node.js

# Introductions

* `Deno` is a server-side `JavaScript` runtime.

* `Deno` is `secure by default`. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.

* `Deno` supports `TypeScript` out of the box.

* `Deno` ships only a single executable file.

* `Deno` has `built-in utilities` like a **dependency inspector** (`deno info`) and a **code formatter** (`deno fmt`).

* `Deno` has a set of `audited standard modules` that are guaranteed to work with Deno: `deno.land/std`
