# Events

* `event listeners`

    ```js
    myButton.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
    ```

* `event delegation` - Attaches one handler per event type to the document node directly, as opposed to attaching it to the DOM nodes on which they were declared. A technique used by `ReactJS` for large pages to reduced computation overhead.

* `event firing`

* `event bubbling`

* `event pooling`
