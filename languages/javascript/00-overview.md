# JavaScript

## Introduction

* `JavaScript` is an `object prototype` based language - New `objects` are instantiated be `cloning` existing objects.

* `JavaScript` is a __very__ `dynamic` language - `objects` properties can `added`/`removed` at `runtime` and `prototypes` can be changed.

* `JavaScript` can be `compiled at execution time`.
