# Variables and Constants

## Introduction

* `c variables` are an `abstraction of the machines memory`.

    * `c variables` can be `pointers`.

    * `pointers` are `memory address` that point to the actual value.

* `c variables` are `typed`.

* `c variables` need to be initialised, otherwise they will take on the current value of the memory location they are allocated.

* `c constants` are usually defined globally as `macros`.
