# Data Types

## Introduction

* `c` supports several `data types` that are strongly tied to the `underlying memory representation` of the variable.

* `c` supports:

    * `int`, `short`, `long`, `uint`

    * `float`, `double`.

    * `chars` - Defined with single quotes.

        ```c
        char some_char = 'C'.
        ```

* Each `c` data type defines data of a `fixed size`.
