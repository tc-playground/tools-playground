# Data Types

## Introduction

* `c` supports several `data types` that are strongly tied to the `underlying memory representation` of the variable.

* `c` supports various `primitives` available in different sizes:

    * `int`, `short`, `long`, `uint` - Integer number of varying size and interpretation.

    * `float`, `double` - Floating point number with varying precision.

    * `char`, `uchar` - Defined with single quotes.

        ```c
        char some_char = 'C'.
        ```
* `c` supports `strings` - a list of characters terminated by the `\O` - `null character`.

* `c` supports several basic types of `structure`.

    * `typed array` - A list of contiguous integer indexed arrays by type.

    * `struct` - A structure with a fixed set of variables and a fixed memory size.

    * `union` - A structure whose members can take on various types.

* Each `c` data type defines data of a `fixed size`.
