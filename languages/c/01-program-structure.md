# Program Structure

## Introduction

* `c` programs are `procedural`.

* The main unit of organization is a `function`.

* `c source code` can be split over multiples files, and `constants`, `variables`, and `functions` can be imported.

* `c compiled binaries` be split over multiples files (`libraries`), and `constants`, `variables`, and `functions` can be imported. 

* `c header files` are used by the `preprocessor` to declare `source file` and `library` resources to import and use. 

* `c programs` have a `main` function where the program starts.

* `c` programs consist of `expressions` and `statements`.

    * `expressions` - Are combinations of `operators` and/or `operands` that return a `result`.

    * `statements` - Are the basic program steps. They may consist of expression.

        * `expression`, `assignment`, `function call`, `structure`, `return`, etc.

        * `statements` end in semicolon `;`.

* `c` programs use `blocks` for scope. These are defined by a pair of curly braces `{}`.
