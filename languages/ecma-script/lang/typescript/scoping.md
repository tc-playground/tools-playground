# Scope and Context

## Introduction

* __Scope__

    * `scope` is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of the code during runtime.

    * `scope` is created at various levels: `global`, `local`, `block`.

    * `lexical/static scoping` in a set of `nested scopes`, allows the `inner scopes` to access variables of the `outer scopes`.

    * `scope visibility` can be defined with `public` and `private` scopes.

* __Context__

    * `execution context` refers to the value of `this` in a particular part of your code.

    * `execution context` can also be called `calling context`.

    * The `execution context` can be managed by `call, apply, bind` operations.

    * `Arrow functions` `() => { }` can be used to automatically bind the execution context to the function.


> `scope` refers to the visibility of variables, and `context` refers to the value of `this` in the same scope.
