# Enums

## const enums

* In TypeScript a const object literal can be used as a limited enum:

    ```ts
    enum PointType {
        2D = "2d",
        3D =  "3d"
    }
    ```

## const structs

* In JavaScript a const object literal can be used as a limited enum:

    ```js
    const PointType = {
        2D: "2d",
        3D: "3d"
    }
    ```
