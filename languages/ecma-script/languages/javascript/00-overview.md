# JavaScript

## Introduction

* `JavaScript` is an `object prototype` based language - New `objects` are instantiated be `cloning` existing objects.

* `JavaScript` is a __very__ `dynamic` language
    * `objects` properties can `added`/`removed` at `runtime`
    * `prototypes` can be changed.

* `JavaScript` can be `interpreted` or `compiled` at execution time.

* A complete `JavaScript` implementation is made up of three distinct parts:
    * The `Core` (based on ECMAScript spec),
    * The `Document Object Model (DOM)`.
    * The `Browser Object Model (BOM)`.

* `JavaScript` source files are executed by a `JavaScript (ECMAScript) Engine`.
    * e.g. `V8`, `SpiderMonkey`, `WebKit`, etc.

* `JavaScript Engines` are embedded in a `JavaScript Runtime`.
    * e.g. `Chrome`, `FireFox`, `Safari`, `Electron`, `NodeJS`, `Deno`.
