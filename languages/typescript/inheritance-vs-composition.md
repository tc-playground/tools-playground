# Inheritance vs Composition

## Inheritance

* `base class` is `extended via inheritance` to add custom functionality.

* Classes are bound by a `is a` relationship.

---

## Composition

* `base class` contains a `reference` and `delegates` to that to implement custom functionality.

* Classes are bound by a `has a` relationship.
