# Python Syntax

---

## `def` keyword

* The `def` keyword is used to define `the `constructor` and `methods` on the `class`.

    ```python
    class SomeClass:

        def __init__(self):
            pass

        def some_method(self):
            pass
    ```

---

## `class` keyword

* The `class` keyword is used to define a new python class.

    ```python
    class SomeClass:
        pass
    ```

* `CamelCase` names are best practice.

---

## `pass` keyword

* The `pass` keyword is used to skip an implementation block.

    ```python
    def some_method(self):
        pass
    ```
