# NumPy

## Overview

* `NumPy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

    * A powerful `N-dimensional array object`.

    * Useful `linear algebra`, `Fourier transform`, and `random number` capabilities.

    * Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.

    * Tools for integrating `C/C++` and `Fortran` code.

* `NumPy` can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. 

* `NumPy` data-types can be defined. 

* `NumPy` can seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

* `NumPy` is part of the `SicPy` stack.
