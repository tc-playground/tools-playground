## Python Installation

1. Install `python` or `python3` via the OS package manager as appropriate.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3
    sudo apt install pip3
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

> A specific version of python can also be installed and used from a `virtual environment`. In this case it is named just `python`.
