# Big O Notation

## Introduction

* `Big O Notation` is a measure of the `complexity` of an `algorithm`.

* The `complexity` of an algorithm concerns the `trade-off` between:

    * `time` - How long does it take to `execute`?

    * `space` - How much `memory` does it use?

* __Complexity Grades__

    1. __Constant__ - `O(1)` - The best!

    2. __Log Linear__ - `O(log N)` - Nearly constant!

    3. __Linear__ - `O(N)` - Usable with `scaling`.

    4. __Exponential__ - `O(N^2)` - Avoid.

    5. __Factorial__ - `O(N!)!` - Avoid.
