# gRPC and Protocol Buffers

* `JSON/HTTP` is suitable for public facing endpoints.

* `gRPC` can be used for communication between internal endpoints.

* `gRPC` uses `protocol buffers` / `protobuf`.

* `Protocol Buffers`:

    * Guarantees type-safety.
    * Prevents schema-violations.
    * Enables fast serialization.
    * Offers versioning and backward compatibility.
    * High performance binary protocol.
    * Language agnostic.

* `Protocol Buffers` uses a `compiler` and a `schema definition` to generate `transport objects` in the target language.
